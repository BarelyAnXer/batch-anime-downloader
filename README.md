Batch anime downloader is a Cross platform Batch Anime downloader desktop app made with
Eel (Eel is a little Python library for making simple Electron-like offline HTML/JS GUI apps,
with full access to Python capabilities and libraries.). I made this software since i was done
trying to download anime one by one. I learned a lot building this project
but most importantly i learned web scraping while building this project


## How to run
download demo.mkv to see the demo of the software working in the video you can only see one episode downloading
but thats only because the anime i choosed at that time has only one episode but it will work on anime with multiple episode as you can see
in the demo1.png unfortunately i dont have a video of that also it doesnt work anymore 4anime the website im scraping has change their html
